		  <div>Established: August 2025</div>
		  <div>TacoBucket opens a 0.8 star restaurant in Restaurant Tycoon 3. Unfortunatley however it isn't the most reputable restaurant of the bunch. It recieved a low star rating due to numerous complaints regarding staffing, quality of food, and hygiene practices. Despite this it continues to serve dozens of NPC customers daily</div>

		  <div>Game link: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/185655149/Welcome-to-Bloxburg">Welcome to Bloxburg, Roblox</a></div>
		  <div>Established: 2024</div>
		  <div>The first branch in Bloxburg nestled in the PineView Mall. It included a modified menu that was compatible with bloxburg's food. Unfortunatley, PineView Mall officially closed down due to brankrupcy, lack of customers, and structual issues. TacoBucket reopens in the same location as a standalone restaurant</div>

          <img src="tacobucketbrubaloplaza.png" width="500px" height="500px" alt="Photo of Taco Bucket Brubalo Plaza">
          <h3>Brubalo Plaza</h3>
		  <div>Main game: Welcome to Bloxburg</div>
		  <div>Game link: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/185655149/Welcome-to-Bloxburg">Welcome to Bloxburg, Roblox</a></div>
		  <div>Established: 2024</div>
		  <div>This TacoBucket is located in the brubalo plaza, a multi-use hotel building with a shopping space on the ground floor. It was primarily visited by the fellow residents and hotel goers of the plaza. Unfortunatley however, Brubalo Plaza faced a similar fate of PineView mall due to a lack of maintenance and modernization. The hotel quickly grew out of fashion, stores relocated, and customer counts declined. In 2024 the Brubalo Plaza has shuttered it's doors, leaving TacoBucket the only remaining tenant in the building. TacoBucket relocated from the shopping space to the hotel's former pool room in front of the property. TacoBucket remains open, still tethered to the now abandoned hotel.</div>

          <img src="tacobucketcobblestonemall.png" width="500px" height="500px" alt="Photo of Taco Bucket Laguna">
          <h3>Cobblestone Mall</h3>
		  <div>Main game: Welcome to Bloxburg</div>
		  <div>Game link: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/185655149/Welcome-to-Bloxburg">Welcome to Bloxburg, Roblox</a></div>
		  <div>Established: 2025</div>
		  <div>This TacoBucket was located in the Cobblestone Mall in late 2024, situated in the center of Laguna City. It was the smallest TacoBucket location yet, measuring a mere 6x4 metres in size. Due to a lack of sales, it has relocated to a neighbouring commercial building that has more space and foot traffic. However as TacoBucket aims towards more games other than Bloxburg, this location is in risk of closing altogether.</div>

          <h3>Brublandia Grand Mall</h3>
		  <div>Main game: Welcome to Bloxburg</div>
		  <div>Game link: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/185655149/Welcome-to-Bloxburg">Welcome to Bloxburg, Roblox</a></div>
		  <div>Established: 2025</div>
		  <div>This TacoBucket is located in the food court of the Brublandia Grand Mall, a massive 3 storey shopping mall in Bloxburg. This is the most succesful bloxburg branch today. As previous Bloxburg locations get phased out such as PineView, Brubalo Plaza, and Cobblestone mall. This will soon become the main TacoBucket to operate in bloxburg</div>
