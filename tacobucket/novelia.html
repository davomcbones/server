	  	  <p>Originally, as of 2025 it was thought that Always Toast has created the TacoBucket name, however new lore has just been discovered in a website called the Novelian Encyclopedia. The origins of TacoBucket became even more mysterious as there are multiple references of TacoBucket in this wiki fandom page. Novelian appears to be a fictional nation using gMod. The purpose or even the creator of this wiki page remains unknown, however the information on this site was impressivley in depth. Taco Bucket's roots supposedly trace further than AlwaysToast's custom compaign map, beginning on Novelia's Golden City. In this alternate Universe Taco Bucket is a Novelian-based fast food restaurant chain owned by a company called Jerseth Entertainment. The company was founded in 1990 by retired film director Seth Brown and technician Jeremy Colt. The restaurants are known for their animatronics which move and performs on stages in the restaurants, similarly to how Freddy Fazbear's Pizza operates their animatronics. The first restaurant was made in 1990 when Seth Brown bought a small store where he began selling tacos. The mascot which he had worked on with Jeremy, attracted people to the restaurant. They then made a deal with businessman Tyson Clark to open two more restaurants in Goldencity and Feng. The restaurant chain has around 8300 restaurants as of 2023. They expanded to Europe, Oceania and South America in the 2000's and 2010's. They further expanded to Asia in 2024.</p><p> With this fascinating new information, TacoBucket's timeline remains a mysterious cluster of alternate universes as the community made fast food franchise has no official original creator. If you found more evidence of TacoBucket please let us know on our discord server we really appreciate it! All locations that were referenced by the Novelian Encyclopedia is displayed below</p>
