    <h2>an HP Chromebook 11 EE</h2>
    <p>
	This thing is a piece of crap, im sorry, it really is. it used to be owned by a freind of mind, but it decided to die so hard that not even professional repairers could fix it like they literally just went "nah, just get a new one". instead it was donated to me and i somehow managed to fix it by unscrewing everything and putting it back together.. anyway, this thing ran badly from the start. it ran chromeos which doesnt work for me, and has hardware which is comparable to an actually decent computer... back in the 2000's<br>
	<br>
    USED AS: i dont know what to do with this?!1?!1!?!? <br>
	CPU: Intel Celeron N4000 (bad)<br>
	RAM: 2GB LPDDR something<br>
	GPU: nothing, literally nothing<br>
	STORAGE: 32GB EMMC storage, its basically just an sd card<br>
	NETWORK: everything is soldered so its extremly difficult to figure out what is what here

    <h2>2021 Lenovo V14-ARE</h2>
    <p>
	My current daily driver, the ThinkPad X220 no matter how much i want to keep daily driving it, is unfortunatley no longer powerful for what i need it for in school, not to mention its battery is already dying again after it's 5th replacement. When buying a new laptop, i had settled with a few requirements. It must have a decent amount of ports, it must have good specs to last alteast 10 years, it MUST be upgradable at any way. I have settled with this Lenovo V14-ARE, it still is mostly upgradable, with enough ports, and with the proper upgrades down the line it should last long enough. the only things i dont like about this though, is the way to open it and the lack of usb c, at the time i didnt know usb c will take off like crazy<br>
	<br>
    USED AS: Daily driver<br>
	CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 4500U<br>
	RAM: 20GB DDR4 2667MHz<br>
	GPU: AMD Radeon something<br>
	STORAGE: 500GB Crucial P2 Nvme SSD<br>
	NETWORK: Qualcomm Atheros
